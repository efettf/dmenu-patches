Colored Caret
=============

Description
-----------
By default, dmenu does not give you the option to change its caret's color. If
you want to change the caret's color to something other than the default white
color, this plugin provides an option to do that. You just need to change the
`SchemeCaret` color in `config.h`. By default, it is set to the foreground color
for `SchemeSel`. Therefore, it will maintain dmenu's default appearance but give
you the ability to change another aspect of it.
